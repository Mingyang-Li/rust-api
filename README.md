# ðŸ¦€ Rust API (REST)

## An introduction to rust

## Background
I decided to learn rust by building a simple REST API. Currently, the plan is to learn how to build a simple REST interface using the language without introducing any complexities such as databases, caching, or authentication, etc. This project is a web server that exposes a few endpoints doing dummy CRUD operations. The next step would be to introduce OpenAPI docs generation, and then dockerise & deploy it to the cloud.

## How to run the project locally?
1. Make sure you have rust installed
2. Clone the repo locally
3. Run this command in terminal: `cargo run` - it starts the server
4. To test the APIs locally, open (or download & install) Postman, import the API collection from [postman/collection.json](./postman/collection.json), and then import [postman/environment.json](./postman/environment.json) as your new environment.
